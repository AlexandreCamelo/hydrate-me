# hydrate-me

Complete app for daily hydration administration.

Calculates water consumption, according to gender, age and weight.

Builds small daily hydration plan, scheduling reminders for the user to drink water throughout the day. As you drink water, the user must inform the app, which will store and organize this information.

It keeps a history of all the times the user drank water, shown graphically, so that you can easily follow if hydration is going well.

Built in react native, using expo.

This app has been successfully published on the play store. However, after a few weeks, google deleted it, stating that there were “special characters” in the app title. As I was annoyed (and too lazy to correct it), I decided to share it publicly on github.

Despite being a simple application, I say that it was a lot of work to build it. In this way, I know that it will be able to help a lot of people who are starting in this technology, since it involves massive push notifications, among other functions.

The entire visual part of the app is in Brazilian Portuguese (I was too lazy to translate it into English), but you can easily do that.

Anyone can use, modify and publish this code in any way they see fit. I just ask you to give me some credit, in the form of publicity on my github channel.
